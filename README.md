# JVM Bloggers
    Never miss any blog post from developers around JVM in Poland

## Overview
Goal of this project is to gather information about every developer writing about JVM related technologies in Poland, no matter if he is oldschool Java fanboy, fancy Scala lover or niche Gosu expert.

I want to promote blogging as the best way to share knowledge and learn from your readers at the same time. And the best way to do that is by informing developers in Poland about new blog posts.

##### Your blog is missing? 
Please create a Pull Request adding it to [bloggers.json](https://github.com/tdziurko/jvm-bloggers/blob/master/bloggers.json) and that's all. Once it is merged, you are on the list!

## Roadmap

1. Send weekly e-mail about latest blog posts to JUG mailing lists
2. Send information about new blog posts using Twitter and Facebook profiles
3. Count clicks to find most popular articles and promote them

##### Maybe in the future
* add technical blogs from Polish companies
* analyze tweets from developers and highlight those with most RTs, stars and the most active conversations
* .... this is a place for __YOUR__ idea :)

## Technical details

Application is written using Java 8, Spring Boot, Liquibase, Akka and JPA, running on PostgreSQL database. So far it is deployed on my home server but there are plans to move it to more reliable location (Heroku, AWS or something similar).

## Contributing
