## Overview

The goal of the **jvm-bloggers** project is to collect information about developers and companies blogging about JVM-related technologies in Poland, despite these bloggers being old-school
Java fanboys, fancy Scala lovers or niche Gosu experts.

On Fridays 7am, this application is sending a newsletter with all new blog posts from the past 7 days.

If you want to have your group or personal e-mail added, please reach out to me (address below).

I'm promoting blogging as the best activity to share knowledge, passion and learn from each other. And the best way to do that is by helping bloggers to reach out to a wider audience.

##### Your blog/JUG/conference is missing?

Please create a Pull Request adding it to

* [bloggers.json](src/main/resources/blogs/bloggers.json) for personal blogs

* [companies.json](src/main/resources/blogs/companies.json) for company blogs

* [videos.json](src/main/resources/blogs/videos.json) for videos from JUGs/Meetups/Conferences/personal vblogs

* [podcasts.json](src/main/resources/blogs/podcasts.json) for personal and company podasts

and that's all. Once it is merged, you are in the list!
